## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I enjoyed the SuperLearner Article. I already view learning as a process that requires a lot of reading and growth mindset to keep pushing yourself to grow. I will start utilizing the short breaks to help maintain focus and help with retention. I would add in the description of taking care of your brain that meditation has been shown to help with cognitive function as another way to take care of the brain.

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

interpolation is when you create variables (placeholders) with specific values yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.

``` ruby
puts "Is a #{animal} black with white stripes or white with black stripes."
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

**. split** breaks the string into words and returns as an array of those words.
