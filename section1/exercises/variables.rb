# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
dobby_warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts dobby_warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
more_students = students + 2
puts more_students
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
less_students = students - 2
puts less_students
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Alicia"
is_hungry = "hungrier than a tic on a teddybear!"
number_of_pets = 2

puts "Hi my name is #{first_name}. I have #{number_of_pets} dogs and they are #{is_hungry} "

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain.
# first_name is easiest to write as a string because it's a word.
#I chose a string for is_hungry to convey a longer statment about hunger.
# I chose a number to reprsent number_of_pets to convey the number of pets



# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Al"
is_hungry = "too full to function"
number_of_pets = 4

puts "#{first_name} just fed their #{number_of_pets} cats and they are #{is_hungry}!"


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "The total number of snacks is #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
